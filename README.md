# Forbes-Highest-Paid-Athletes-Analysis


The "Forbes Highest-Paid Athletes Analysis" project is a comprehensive study aimed at unravelling insights into the financial aspects of top-performing athletes. The dataset includes key features such as Serial Number (S.NO), Name, Nationality, Current Rank, Previous Year Rank, Sport, Year, and earnings in million dollars ($ million).

The project underwent a robust Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to ensure data accuracy and integrity. Cleaning procedures were implemented to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset. Subsequently, the data was scaled to facilitate meaningful comparisons and analyses.

Statistical methods were applied to discern patterns, trends, and correlations within the dataset. Utilizing the Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries, visualizations were generated to provide intuitive representations of the data, aiding in the interpretation of athlete earnings dynamics over time and across sports.
