Project Title: Forbes Highest-Paid Athletes Analysis


The "Forbes Highest-Paid Athletes Analysis" project is a comprehensive study aimed at unraveling insights into the financial aspects of top-performing athletes. The dataset includes key features such as Serial Number (S.NO), Name, Nationality, Current Rank, Previous Year Rank, Sport, Year, and earnings in million dollars ($ million).

The project underwent a robust Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to ensure data accuracy and integrity. Cleaning procedures were implemented to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset. Subsequently, the data was scaled to facilitate meaningful comparisons and analyses.

Statistical methods were applied to discern patterns, trends, and correlations within the dataset. Utilizing the Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries, visualizations were generated to provide intuitive representations of the data, aiding in the interpretation of athlete earnings dynamics over time and across sports.

To predict the earnings of athletes, the project employed the Random Forest Regressor, a machine learning algorithm known for its predictive accuracy. This model was trained on historical data to establish patterns and relationships, enabling the projection of athlete earnings based on relevant features.

The "Forbes Highest-Paid Athletes Analysis" project not only contributes valuable insights into the financial landscape of top athletes but also showcases the application of advanced data processing, statistical analysis, and machine learning techniques. The outcomes of this analysis can be instrumental for athletes, sports organizations, and investors in making informed decisions in the dynamic world of sports and finance.
